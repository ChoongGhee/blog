### Tree
### Overview
- a type of [Graph Graph](/그래프-Graph)
- [자료구조 Data Structure](/자료구조-Data-Structure)
- **DAG** (Directed Acyclic Graph) *(Directed acyclic graph)* (Acyclic graph with a direction)

# condition
- the graph
- all vertices are connected.
# Phylogenetic tree (kind)

{% note info %}
**what's confusing**
> [Minimum Spanning Tree Minimum Spanning Tree](/최소-스패닝-트리-Minimum-Spanning-Tree) is [Algorithm Algorithm](/알고리듬-Algorithm).
{% endnote %}
> **Finding a tree in a graph that satisfies certain conditions**. it is an algorithm rather than a data structure.

## Types
- [Binary Tree Binary Tree](/이진-트리-Binary-Tree)
- [Multi-way Tree Multi-way Tree](/다진-트리-Multi-way-Tree)
- specialty trees: a bunch of other trees, etc
